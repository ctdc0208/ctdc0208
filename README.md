### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christian, a Front-End Developer based in PhilippinesPH.
</br>
</br>
My journey began with a love for all things tech that led to experiences that honed my problem-solving skills. Today, web development has become one of the things I enjoy doing the most! Where I learn and implement technologies to create visually stunning and functional designs.
</br>
</br>
I primarily focus on front-end tasks, but I also enjoy a range of areas, from design to backend, tinkering with different aspects of web development.
